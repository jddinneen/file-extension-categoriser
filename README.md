# file-extension-categoriser
A classification scheme (and python function) for categorising file extensions into broad file types.

The file 'binfiles.py' contains the categories and their related extensions, and a simple function that can be called to check some extension string against the lists and return a category.

The file 'categories-by-collection-type.xls' provides descriptive statistics for how files of those categorised types comprise six kinds of file collections, as seen in data collected and described in a forthcoming manuscript (submitted for review).
